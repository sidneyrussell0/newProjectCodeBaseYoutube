                <p>Born and raised on the west coast, my parents raised my in the family photography business. From a young
                age I knew the ins and outs of how an office worked. Wanting to be successful much like them I decided to become
                an entrepreneur and began a career in the beauty industry straight out of high school. After 10 years of working
                my dream job I became interested in learning something new and found that I loved the creativity and complexity 
                that makes up the world of coding.<!-- (that makes of the coding world.) -->I am currently a Full-Stack Engineer 
                student through Codecademy and part time student with Code First Girls. Going into this field I know that my goal
                is to not only begin a career in the tech industry but to contribute my knowledge to help the people in this world 
                who need it the most. I would love to find a company who works on innovative projects that make a difference. </p>
